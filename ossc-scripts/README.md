## Running on the OSSC

Use local datasets and store them in `datasets/`. Ideally use text-based file formats such as json for easier inspection by CBS.
- The file `alpaca_data_cleaned.json` was downloaded from https://huggingface.co/datasets/yahma/alpaca-cleaned/tree/main on 27/01/2025.

## Getting code to OSSC

1. Make release on GitHub 
2. Import code via CBS upload/download portal
    - Make sure the code can work with local datasets.
3. Ask SURF to install dependencies
